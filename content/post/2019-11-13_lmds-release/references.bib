	title = {Sparse multidimensional scaling using landmark points},
	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss a computationally eﬃcient approximation to the classical multidimensional scaling ({MDS}) algorithm, called Landmark {MDS} ({LMDS}), for use when the number of data points is very large. The ﬁrst step of the algorithm is to run classical {MDS} to embed a chosen subset of the data, referred to as the ‘landmark points’, in a low-dimensional space. Each remaining data point can be located within this space given knowledge of its distances to the landmark points. We give an elementary and explicit theoretical analysis of this procedure, and demonstrate with examples that {LMDS} is eﬀective in practical use.},
