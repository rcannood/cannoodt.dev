abstract: "The Rocker Project provides widely-used Docker images for R across different application scenarios. This articles surveys downstream projects building upon Rocker and presents the current state of R packages for managing Docker images and controlling containers. These use cases and the variety of applications demonstrate the power of Rocker specifically and containerisation in general. We identified common themes across this diversity: reproducible environments, scalability and efficiency, and portability across clouds."
